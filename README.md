# What is this?
Hello and welcome to this "profile" I've decided to create. 

1. Who am I
   I'm Mavelovent, though I usually go by Mav. I'm a male human with severe social issues, likely causesd by asperger syndrome. I struggle with communication that extends anywhere beyond basic conversation or orders. That means that I'm not used to any chat that is centered around recreation, fun, socializing. Most of my time was spent studying and playing games when I was looking for a challenge. It wasn't until many years have passed that I realised that I can't communicate or form any sort of relationshipss or meaningful friendship. I like to think about it as having played an RPG game called "Life" but after distributing and upgrading my skills, I have never noticed a skill try called "socializing", I didn't put any points into it and now I've ran out of them.
   That said, having a happy family and a trusting friend circle has been my dream, though I have for the longest time imagined that the key to it is through having good grades in school, high intelligence and skills that come with problem solving. I didn't realize that I actually need to talk with people in order to befriend them (in hindsight that seems obvious). That almost feels like I've ran a marathon but only after having the distance required covered I'm told that I've been running in the opposite direction. Now I'm trying to fix that, mainly by seeking friendship online, but also irl to a degree. I haven't had much success in that, so due to years of unsuccesful interaction, depression settled in. I'm trying to fight it. It's tough.

3. Why am I making this
   Despite the many failures in the past I want to change something and improve. I want to find friends. Someone I can trust, talk regularly with. Someone that I can learn forom how to be... "human".
   How would that happen? I am not entirely sure. But in order to make it less painful I imaginer having similar interests and spending time in a mutually enjoyable fashion would likely be a good idea. For me that means playing games together. I have noticed that I primarily learn about people, who they are and what their values are by playing games with them. As such, I'd like to simply play something together as starters, see if we get along and if so, we can perhaps make it along term thing.
