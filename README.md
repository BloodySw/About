# What is this?
Hello and welcome to this "profile" I've decided to create. 	

# Who am I
I am Mavelovent. A nerd. Programmer. Enjoyer of games, especially lesser known, but well crated indie ones. Creating logical combinations, connections, making rational decisions is what I truly enjoy. All of this primarily culminates in solving puzzles of various kind. I see every part of the world as a puzzle that waits to be solved. This stems from me being an aspie (Asperger syndrome - or Autistic spectrum, though in my opinion it's way too big of a general group). I have one strong interest in which I excel and truly enjoy, and that is solving puzzles, usually in form of a game. Be it computer games, board games, social games, real life problem solving: it's all puzzles. Problems only arise when some things... can't be easily solved. Either the data or tools at hand are incomplete or obscured. Imagine solving a Rubik's cube, but you are colorblind. All the sides and colors looks mostly the same. And also you don't know how to turn the elements properly. Being unable to solve such puzzle is... infuriating, annoying to me. And unfortunately, that's how I view social interactions (among other things).


# My breakdown
For the longest time I would believe in something I'd call "destiny", where things like "friends", "love", "companionship", "trust" would come to you in time, if you simply followed the path given and kept obeying orders (such as those from teachers and parents). Also that's how I understood the meaning behind lyrics of some songs, that stated "you can't hurry love". And so I waited, patiently. I succeeded in school, gotten excellent grades, always obeyed every rule I was given. I spent my ample amount of free time playing games, where puzzles where plenty. Discovering different fantastic worlds, optimizing, calculating, creating tactics and learning stories they offered. All while I patiently awaited for the time I'll be "happy" and find "friends", "love". I assumed the time will come once I enter adult life, which will be around 18 years old. I ignored social gatherings as these were incredibely hard for me to understand and didn't follow any rules I have previously known, none of those given by parents, teachers, schools or games. It was wild west. And so I negleted aspect of social life. But adult life came and... nothing changed. I kept following orders, kept getting good grades but something inside me was breaking. It was my belief in the so called "destiny". Peers around me were starting to form relationships, making families: things I so strongly desired. I believed those are formed based on your intelligence and success in school, yet people that had significantly worse grades and performance were much happier than me? they were much further in life? My belief and motivation started to crumble. Depression hit. And still I can't crawl out of it. I don't want to talk about what happened afterwards as these are my darkest days but the thing is.... I want to get out of it. I want to get out of this camp at the bottom of the well that I created and maintained. I want to make actual friends, form relationships. Hence why I'm writing all this.

(Oh, also I did experience things like one sided love, heartbreaks, rejection and being casted away, but that's a bit of a longer story)

   
# What am I looking for
I want to make actual friends, ideally female ones so that I can earn some experience with opposite gender. For now interacting with girls is still a storngly taboo subject for me, so is any type of affection or emotion showing. I want to learn how to talk, interact and behave like a human. And preferably do it in a not therapy-like fashion (tried those, didn't work). I want to experience happiness (I can count on fingers of my one hand the amount of times I've felt it), enjoy spending time with someone. Nerd out. Play games together. Understand another human. Let the rules of social interaction no longer be a colorblind Rubik's cube. So... simply put I want to play games and be friends with a girl. That shouldn't be difficult... right? The amount of time I have spent attempting this proves that it actually is.

# What I expect
Not much, but I think there are a few elementary things I'd expect. 

1. Be open minded. I'm weird in many ways, so don't expect anything normal. I tend to break many social rules without realizing.
2. Enjoy games, especially unusual, indie ones. I need us to have at least one common interest/activity in order to get along and common game seems ideal.
3. Have free time to talk and play games together. Ideally daily but at least weekly.
4. Be honest. I tend to be absurdily honest due to my condition, hopefully you can both take it and be honest back. I want to learn, to grow, so I want to take constructive criticism about my behavior.
5. Be female. Controversial topic, I know, especially in this age, but it's kind of important for me.

Nice qualities to have as well would include would also be

1. Be good at games. It's especially nice to test mettle with someone and hone those skills (hopefully those aren't useless)
2. Be intelligent. I tend to operate strongly on logic and decision making. Illogical behavior tends to get on my nervs quickly.
3. Be.... weird? It's better to be original (Also I'd add <sub>lewd</sub>, but aparently having preference for that is often frowned upon).
4. Be willing to grow. I want to improve and ideally we can improve together
5. Be... <sub>single</sub>? Not gonna lie, I do want to form a relationship some day with someone. I'd like to see it at least as a potential.


Ok, this is starting to sound like a job post rather than a friend seeking post with all those requirements and offers, but sadly I don't know how else to put those, other than in an organized fashion. My main interaction with people for some time has been via job offerings. If you have suggestions in terms of how to structure it better, I'd welcome feedback.

# What can I offer
Since I demand quite a few things, I want to make sure that I can offer some things back to make it more equal (cam you all it "transaction"? Feels a bit wrong)

1. Skill and insight into a variety of games. I've spent vast amount of my life playing games so I'm happy to recommend, describe and teach them.
2. Time. Provided we get along well and enjoy each others company I can offer a lot of time. I tend to have too much of it to spend.
3. Shoulder to cry on. This of course requires trust and likely many of you aleady have those sorted. But if not, and there is trust established, then perhaps I can offer some... shoulder?
4. Honesty. I tend to be way too honest. Blessing anda curse. Most people say they love when people are honest and transparent, though most bail when they realize just how straightforward I am.
5. Writing. I like to write. Though I haven't done it in a long while, I do enjoy roleplay, creating imaginary worlds and then writing them down in order to enjoy it together. Maybe share it later on.
6. Insight into my situation. I enjoy answering any types of questions, be it about my experience or affliction. If you are interested at all, I'd be happy to share.
7. Help in school/study. I had excellent marks in school, so I think I'm good in many subjects, especially math, physics and such. I might be a bit bad at transfering that knowledge, but hey, free tuition?
8. Weird <sub>lewd</sub> recommendations. Ahem.

Not sure what else I can offer, but feel free to come up with ideas in terms of what else you might expect of me. 

# Interests
Things that we can hopefully bond over. Discuss, nerd, play, chat, exchange, whatever. Perhaps I can intrests you in some of those?

1. Games. This is a big one for me. Playing and mulling over various types of games. PC games, console games (I don't have a console), mobile games, boards games, card games, social games, word games, enviromental games, sports games (I'm not exactly athletic though), whatever. I enjoy anything that qualifies as a game of any sort. Life is an RPG game (and I didn't put any points into 'social skills')
2. Fantasy. I enjoy any type of magic settings, be it in games, books, manga, anime, movies. It reminds me of world of imagination where I often escaped. Anything is possible there. Magic!
3. Manga. Also anime but I tend to prefer the static nature of manga more, where you can read and turn pages at your own pace. I used to like Shounen most, but recently I started to browse other types as well. Japanese culture is interesting in many ways.
4. Puzzles. Logic. whatever you want to call it. Kind of similar to games but in a bit of a broader sense. Sudoku, dexterity puzzles or just solving math problems. Yes, I believe math is fun.
5. Taboo stuff. I like to question social rules and norms. And then break them if I don't see reason in them. If it's weird and taboo to discuss, I probably like it.
6. Science. I like to learn in general. I didn't understand quantum mechanics at school so I studied it on my own with youtube and wikipedia mostly (reliable enough I hope).
7. Pets. I have a cat. I love cats. They are like introverts but in pet form. My cat is the main thing that forces me to smile and get out of bed when I'm dark mood. Also I like snakes, but mostly in imaginary scenarios.
8. Cycling. Not exactly an interests since I don't inherently enjoy it, but it atleast helps me stay more or less in shape and works as a method of transportation.

Maybe in time I'll get more interests.


# Achievements
Well, as I have probably stated plenty of time before, I enjoy games. I enjoy playing games well. I'd even call myself an achievement wh*re, at least for achievemnts that aren't inherently grindly. I'll happily beat a game on highest difficulty in permadeath mode while blindfolded. But if I am supposed to kill 10,000 skeletons, the game can go to hell.
